# Bioinformatics Experience

### Staff Scientist, Bioinformatics at Takara Bio USA, San Jose CA
- **Duration:** January 2021 to present
- Worked on algorithm and UI development for Embgenix PGT-A software for aneuploidy detection in embryos (https://www.takarabio.com/products/next-generation-sequencing/reproductive-health/embgenix-pgt-a-kit-(ruo)) 
- Collaborated with bench scientists to address bioinformatics needs in DNA-Seq, particularly in reproductive health
- Developed and maintained pipelines and software products to aid design of new products in R&D using Python, Shiny and JavaScript
- Performed DNA-Seq analysis, particularly to aid in detection of copy number variations

### Bioinformatician/Computational Biologist at Michigan Medicine, Ann Arbor MI
- **Duration:** September 2016 to January 2021
- Performed analysis on NGS and array data from ERRBS, ChIP-seq, WGBS, ATAC-Seq (bulk and single cell), EPIC Methylation Array and (h)MeDIP DNA methylation techniques
- Maintained, developed and documented Epigenomic NGS data analysis pipelines using Snakemake, R, Python, Bash, Perl and other open-source bioinformatics programs (sequence quality control, alignment, differential analysis)
- Developed analysis plans and budgets for scientists and communicated results to non-expert audiences effectively
- Analyzed and interpreted bioinformatics, clinical, and physiological data across multiple data types and sources, and across a broad range of analysis approaches and biological and clinical research questions

### Bioinformatics Research Assistant at Purdue University 
- **Duration:** August 2012 to July 2016
- Developed a novel method for scoring gene models for non-model plants
- Performed domain co-occurrence analysis for identifying the pairwise probability of kinase protein domains
- Analyzed RNA-seq data of glyphosate resistant giant ragweed in time course experiments to identify genes responsible for resistance mechanism

### Data Science Intern at Monsanto (later acquired by Bayer CropSciences)
- **Duration:** May 2015 to August 2015
- Investigated the effect of metabolites and genes on selected yield-related phenotypes in corn using machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods and generated a list of most predictive features affecting the yield of corn
- Collaborated with multi-state teams within the company to design and develop web applications in R Shiny
- Communicated results effectively with non-specialist scientists from other teams

# Other Minor Projects 

### Zebrafish DB

- Built a database for maintaining zebrafish lines using RShiny for a lab in UCSF
- Updates status of fish such as birth date, mother, father, generation, etc. to a local SQL database 
- Added function to print label via connected label printer for use with fish tanks in facility 

### [rfeVIP](https://github.com/kpadm/rfeVIP)

- Developed an R package that performs recursive feature elimination based on the variable importance parameter in random forest models using caret 
- Removes negative VIPs and stops when all remaining VIPs are positive

### Web Developer

- Maintained and updated content for the Department of Environmental and Ecological Engineering at Purdue University 
- Overhauled back-end infrastructure to be more robust
- Updated front-end UI to meet University guidelines 
- Held weekly meetings with the department head and administrative director
